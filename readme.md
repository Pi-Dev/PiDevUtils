## Pi-Dev Utilities

**A collection of modular, high-quality utilities for Unity development.**\
All files are licensed under the MIT License unless otherwise specified.

### üì¶ Installation

- Download or clone the repository
- Copy the entire *Assets/PiDev* folder into your Unity project's *Assets* directory.
- You now have full access to all utilities, components, and editor tools.
- Some utilities depend on DoTween by Demigiant. A version of it is included in Assets/DOTween. Make sure to manually update this when necessary, its provided only for the example project to work.
- **Unity 2021.3 LTS** or newer is recommended. *(Older versions may work but are not officially tested.)*

### üóíÔ∏è Note about Examples

Pi-Dev Utilities is intended to include proper usage examples, but at the moment, a full sample package isn't available. Most utilities and components are straightforward to use, but I'm aware that a few ‚Äî particularly the Adaptive UI tools ‚Äî can feel complex or underdocumented.

In the future, I plan to add sample scenes to better demonstrate these tools in action, especially the Adaptive UI components.  

Thanks for your patience and understanding!
